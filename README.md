Website Overview
We are making an eCommerce website based on IGA, with design aspects inspired by sites like: Flipkart, shopify, IGA. The main functionality is to enable users to add items to their grocery store, Enable admins to add/delete/edit new products and orders. Our main focus is to make the website as simple as possible. We will take a minimalistic approach when it comes to design and appeal.

More in-depth
Clients create a profile(we collect the user information here), then start browsing “recommendations” from each aisle(organize your products as “aisles” e.g. vegetables and fruits, beverages, dairy, and eggs, etc). They can add a product to their shopping cart. A separate page shopping cart( the user is able to add products into the shopping cart. The user is able to display the content of his/her shopping cart and edit the quantity of the products or delete a product.)

There is also another admin profile that has the functionality to add new products to the existing database. As well as, delete & edit products. And change orders placed by the client.

We may also add a search page, where different filters could be added to find their target product. If time permits we may also add an email confirmation for the clients. 


The next section will be divided into implementation and execution:
What to do / Implementation: 
The project is supposed to be divided into 3 work packages

Static implementation of the front-end(i.e the look and feel of the page with no added functionality) - here we will be using HTML(project structure), CSS(look and feel), JavaScript (limited implementation for buttons and navigation/Check js DOM for more info)
Dynamic implementation: This would consist mostly of using JavaScript and Ajax. This would allow us to make changes live on the website(eg, Adding or deleting the product reflecting a change in the shopping cart, selecting the quantity in the shopping cart calculating the total price of the product, etc) There would be a slight overlap between this package and the next package for product description if we choose to go the Database route(we take an existing database and import product directly into our website schema) we will be fetching API using Ajax or directly from our database on our server(our PC or ENCS sever). In contrast, we could go the XML route which is a text file stored on one of our laptops. Decisions could be made based on time constraints.  
Backend implementation: this would use Php to keep track of everything that goes on our website and store it on our database. We could use the PHP-mailer template to add the mailing functionality.


Hosting

I have already purchased a domain name: montrealgreens.store

Along with this we would also need to host our website this could be done in multiple ways:

Using the AITS/ ENCS server. Where we upload everything on the server Via FTP and access our file directly via the ENCS link. This is the easiest option as it does not require setting up a domain. However, we might not be able to host it for long, we would have limited space.
          
           For more info you can go to the ENCS webpage

Aws services: As students, we all get AWS services for free. There is a learning curve but we could apply for our domain. It would also be slightly more inducive to give a better impression on our resumes.

Go to GitHub student developer pack and you could find this service for free along with other stuff, here is a link to Github and this one for AWS.

Heroku: much easier to use, unlike aws(cloud based)  it is a Paas(Platform as a service).




Execution / who does what:

THIS SECTION WILL BE UPDATED FOR EACH ASSIGNMENT

On our GitHub page, under issues, you could assign yourself to your specific page/feature. There will be Deliverables which will be tasks that should be met for each issue.

This section will be for work package 1(Static implementation)

The following groups could share their CSS files:

GRP1: P1, P2
GRP2: P3, P4
GRP3: P5, P6
GRP4: P7, P8, P9 P10, P11, P12
